# Diving Deeper into Machine Learning

We've focused on neural networks, using labeled data that we
can use to learn the trends in our data.  This is an example
of _supervised learning_.  

Broadly speaking there are
3 main [approaches to machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Approaches)

* [Supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) 

  This uses labeled pairs (input and output) to train the model
  to learn how to predict the outputs from the inputs.

* [Unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning)

  No labeled data is provided.  Instead the machine learning
  algorithm seeks to find the structure on its own.  The goal
  is to learn patterns and features to be able to produce
  new data.
  
* [Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)

  As with unsupervised learning, no labeled data is used,
  but the model is "rewarded"  when it does something right,
  and the model tries to maximize rewards (think: self-driving
  cars).
  
## Libraries

There are a number of popular libraries that implement machine learning algorithms.
Their features and performance vary quite a bit.  An comparison of their
features is provided by Wikipedia: [Comparison of deep learning software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_deep_learning_software).

Some additional comparisons are provided here: https://ritza.co/articles/scikit-learn-vs-tensorflow-vs-pytorch-vs-keras/

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

  This is an open source machine learning library released by Google.  It has support
  for CPUs, GPUs, and [TPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit),
  and provides all the features you need to build deep learning workflows:
  [TensorFlow feactures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow#Features).

  You can install tensorflow via:

  ```
  pip install tensorflow
  ```
  
  ```{note}
  At the moment, tensorflow only supports python <= 3.12.  So I'll be using
  pytorch instead (since I am running python 3.13).
  ```
  
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

  This is a machine learning library build off of the Torch library, originally
  developed by Facebook.

  You can install pytorch via:

  ```
  pip install torch
  ```
  
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

  This is a python library developed for machine learning.  It has a lot of
  sample datasets that provide a nice means to learn how different methods work.
  It is designed to work with NumPy and SciPy.
  
  General recommendations on the web seem to be to use Scikit-learn to get
  started with machine learning and to explore ideas, but to switch to
  one of the other packages for computationally-intensive work.

  You can install scikit-learn via:

  ```
  pip install scikit-learn
  ```
  
  Scikit-learn provides some nice sample datasets: 

  https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html
  
  as well as generators for
  datasets:
  
  https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/sample_generators.html
  
There are also tools that provide higher-level interfaces to these

* [Keras](https://keras.io/)

  Keras provides a common python interface to several different machine learning
  libraries, including tensorflow and torch.  This hides a lot of the implementation
  details and makes it easy to get started using these libraries.

## Keras 

We'll focus on Keras.

There are a large number of examples provided by Keras:
