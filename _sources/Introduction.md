(from https://xkcd.com)

## Why python?

* Python is a very high-level language

  * it provides many complex data-structures (lists, dictionaries, ...)

  * your code is shorter than a comparable algorithm in a compiled language

* Many powerful libraries to perform complex tasks

  * Parse structured inputs files

  * send e-mail

  * interact with the operating system

  * make plots

  * make GUIs

  * do scientific computations

  * ...

* Python makes it easy to prototype new tools

* Python is cross-platform and Free

## Language Features

Some of the language features are:

* Dynamical typing

* Object-oriented foundation

* Extensible (easy to call Fortran, C/C++, ...)

* Automatic memory management (garbage collection)

* Ease of readability (whitespace matters)


## Scientific python

Perhaps most importantly, and why we are here:

> Python has been widely adopted in the scientific community.
