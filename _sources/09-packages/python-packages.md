# Packaging



Let's look at the structure of creating an installable python package.

```{note}
The python packaging system is constantly evolving, and the current recommendations
of tools is list here: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/
```

## Our example

We'll work on an example that builds on the Mandelbrot set exercise
from our matplotlib discussion.  Our example is hosted here:

https://github.com/sbu-python-class/mymodule

On your local computer, if you have `git` installed, you can clone this via:

```
git clone https://github.com/sbu-python-class/mymodule.git
```

The directory structure appears as:

```
mymodule/
├── mymodule
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── mandel.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

This is a rather common way of structuring a project:

* The top-level `mymodule` directory is not part of the python
  package, but instead is where the source control (e.g. git) begins,
  and also hosts setup files that are used for installation

* `mymodule/mymodule` is the actual python module that we will load.

   ```{important}
   To make python recognize this as a module, we need an `__init__.py`
   file there&mdash;it can be completely empty.
   ```

* The actual `*.py` files that make up our module are in `mymodule/mymodule`

Right now, this package does not appear in our python search path, so
the only way to load it is to work in the top-level `mymodule/`
directory, and then we can do:

```python
import mymodule.mandel
```

we could also do:

```python
from mymodule.mandel import mandelbrot
```


## setuptools

A popular set of packages are:

* Installation:

  * `pip` to install packages from PyPI
  * `conda` for disctribution cross-platform software stacks

* Packaging tools:

  * `setuptools` to create source distributions
  * `build` for binary distributions
  * `twine` to upload to PyPI

We'll look at how to use [`setuptools`](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/build_meta.html) to package our library.

```{note}
A lot of setuptools documentation is out-of-date and
inconsistent with the packaging guidelines.

Packages used to create a `setup.py` file that had all of the project information,
but this is deprecated.  Instead we should create a
[pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/) file---this
is consistent with [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/).
```

Here's a first `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "mymodule"
description = "test module for PHY 546"
readme = "README.md"
license.text = "BSD"
version="0.1.0"
authors = [
  {name="Michael Zingale"},
  {email="michael.zingale@stonybrook.edu"},
]

dependencies = [
  "numpy",
  "matplotlib",
]

```

Some notes:

* We have a `[build-system]` table that specifies the build tool.
  Here we choose `setuptools`.

* We have a lot of metadata for our project defined in the `[project]`
  table.

* We also list the dependencies of our project in the `[project]` table.
  This will allow the installer to install any missing packages that are
  required.

There are many additional options to specify how to find files that
are part of the project as well as data files, etc.


```{tip}
`pyproject.toml` also allows you to specify defaults for tools, like
`pylint`, `flake8`, and others with a `[tool.X]` subtable.
```

```{note}
Some projects also contain a `setup.cfg`
file when using `setuptools`.  This is
usually not needed, since we can put everything
in the `[project]` table.
```


## Installing

We can now install simply as:

```bash
pip install .
```

```{tip}
Look in your `.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages` directory, and you'll
see the module there.
```

If instead, we want to install in a way that still allows us to edit the source,
we can install as "editable" via:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

To uninstall, we can do:

```bash
pip uninstall mymodule
```

in a directory outside of our project (otherwise, `pip` may get confused).

## Using our module

Once the module is installed, we can use it from any directory.  For example, if we do:

```python
import mymodule
print(mymodule.__file__)
```

it shows us where the module is installed on our system.  In my case, it is:

```
/home/zingale/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/mymodule-0.1.0-py3.12.egg/mymodule/__init__.py
```

Let's generate a plot:

```python
from mymodule.mandel import mandelbrot
fig = mandelbrot(128)
fig.savefig("test.png")
```

This produces the plot shown below:
